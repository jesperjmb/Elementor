# Elementor
A repository of SCCS/CSS snippets created specifically for Elementor. 
Note that mose of these CSS snippets will use the built-in Elementor "selector" instead of a class. This makes it possible to easily copy-paste the CSS into a specific Elementor module. Consider replacing "selector" with your own class if you need to use the CSS for several modules.
